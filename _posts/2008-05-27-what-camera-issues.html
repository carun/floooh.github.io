OMG I can't believe reviewers still bitch about the camera in Ninja Gaiden 2. If it's the same as in NG1 (which they complained about as well when it came out) then it's just perfect. Just tap the right trigger and the camera snaps back behind Ryu. That's the secret to successful camera control in Ninja Gaiden ;)
