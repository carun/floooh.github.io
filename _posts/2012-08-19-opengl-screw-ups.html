A list of embarrasing screw-ups I tend to waste time on (repeatedly) while writing OpenGL based rendering code. The list will surely grow as I continue working on Twiggy :P<br />This is generally stuff which doesn't show up with glGetError() of course. <br /><br /><b>Sampling a texture just returns black pixels in the fragment shader:</b><br /><br />Most likely the texture is incomplete because the texture sampler states GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER hadn't been setup yet, or the FILTER states expects mipmaps but the texture has none.<br />Also on some platforms / drivers it is more efficient to setup those states before calling glTexImage2D().<br /><br /><b>Clearing a render target doesn't work as expected (eg the color buffer is cleared, but the depth buffer isn't): </b><br /><br />glClear() is affected by the state of glColorMask(), glDepthMask(), and glStencilMask(). If glDepthMask() is set to GL_FALSE, the depth buffer won't be cleared even though glClear() is called with the GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT set.<br /><br /><b>Also:</b> <a href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Common_Mistakes">http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Common_Mistakes</a>
