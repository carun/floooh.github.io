Just came across this citation on Slashdot:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"Any third-rate engineer or researcher can increase complexity; but it takes a certain flair of real insight to make things simple again."</span> - E.F.Schumacher.<br /><br />Every programmer and game designer should bow before these mighty words of wisdom. Guess I need to read his book "Small Is Beautiful" now.
