First Nebula3 screenshot fresh from my notebook (please excuse the jpg artefacts):<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_cWdorEDEaNg/RqyVNCT1qNI/AAAAAAAAABE/LwR6_JKovGc/s1600-h/n3first.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_cWdorEDEaNg/RqyVNCT1qNI/AAAAAAAAABE/LwR6_JKovGc/s400/n3first.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5092609329840105682" border="0" /></a><br />It's the Tiger tank from our toolkit examples, loaded through the legacy N2 resource loaders. Visually, it's nothing to write home about of course - it's rendered using the most simple textured shader possible. But nonetheless this is a very important milestone for Nebula3 because all essential building blocks of the Render Layer are now up and running, and a simple render loop is possible. A lot of things still need to be done of course: putting the renderer into its own thread, occlusion culling, realtime lights and shadows, lots of tests and benchmarks, and so on... but once the first triangle is on the screen, the rest is easy ;)
