Here's the PowerPoint of the talk I gave yesterday at the GCDC in Leipzig:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.radonlabs.de/internal/n3talk_gcdc07.zip">n3talk_gcdc07.zip</a><br /><br />If you don't have PowerPoint, there's a standalone reader available for download from MS, just google for "PowerPoint viewer".<br /><br />GCDC is always fun. Unfortunately I could only stay for a few hours and then had to return to Berlin for work. GC is going to be HUUUGE this time. Looks like they've added an additional hall, the business center had to move into a new smaller hall across the "campus". I've been going to GC every year since it started, but I'm still impressed by the Leipzig Exhibition Centre's architecture and size, it's like a trip into the future.
