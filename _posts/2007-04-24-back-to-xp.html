Oh well... I was just installing Visual Studio SP1 over the network and then after 10 minutes of absolutely nothing happening suddenly the screen went black and it was like beeppppeeebbeeeeppeeeepppppp... well not quite, but the machine froze for several minutes and didn't come back. Trying to re-animate with Ctrl-Alt-Del just made things worse, not even the task manager came up. Maybe I'll give it another try after adding more RAM. Other then that it becomes apparent that Vista has some serious problems when heavy file or network stuff is going on. How they could fuckup something fundamental as this  is beyond me. Back to my trusty Dell and XP for now...
