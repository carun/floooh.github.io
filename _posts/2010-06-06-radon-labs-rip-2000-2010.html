<p>Just a quick update, because I don’t have a lot of time for blogging at the moment. As you may have noticed, Radon Labs is no more. The plug was pulled on the planned financing model for the next Drakensang, and in the end we had to pull the plug on the company. The good news in all of this is that there were a lot of interested companies to help us keep the ball rolling, and since Tuesday last week we’re a part of Bigpoint which opens up a lot of new, very interesting directions where Drakensang and the technology behind it will move in the future (obvious hint: the net may play a very important role). Unfortunately it’s too early for me to answer questions regarding Nebula in any meaningful way. We’re currently busy getting to know our new comrades, plotting strategies and making plans.</p>
