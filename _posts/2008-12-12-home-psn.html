I was just checking out Home, and to put it mildly, I was not impressed:<br /><ul><li>I was trying for about 15 minutes to get past the start screen, getting all types of connection errors, then suddenly... one connection attempt worked, as a "casual user" I would have given up after the first four or five errors (which do have intuitive names like "C931").<br /></li><li>I tried for 10 minutes to create a character which doesn't look like shit and failed.<br /></li><li>Downloads and long loading times between sections totally kills the "experience".</li><li>Everything basically looks and feels like it has been designed by yuppie marketeers stuck in the 90's.<br /></li></ul>I doubt I will ever return. Even if Home was "the cool shit", the long startup time kills every impulse to even launch that thing.<br /><br />I don't know... I refuse to believe that Sony is driven by marketing peeps who thought that Second-Life is the next-big-thing during its short media-hype. I just don't "get" it. But who knows, I wasn't "getting" the Wii either, and look how that turned out (yeah, who am I kidding, it's more likely that Home will turn into a wasteland and Sony will let it die a quiet and slow death in a few months). Hmm... wasteland... time to return to Fallout3 :)
