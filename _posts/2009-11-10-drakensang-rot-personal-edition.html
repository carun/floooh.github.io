<p>Check this out: <a href="http://www.amazon.de/amflussderzeit" target="_blank">www.amazon.de/amflussderzeit</a></p>  <p>Amazon starts pre-ordering for the super-limited German *personalized edition* of “<em>Drakensang - River Of Time”</em> with your own name on the box. First time any game offers this, as far as we’re aware at least. I really, really dig the DVD box cover by the way. We got some of those posters a few days ago and they’re simply admirable :o)</p>
