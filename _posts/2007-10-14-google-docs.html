I recently had to wipe and setup my notebook (it's amazing how fast it feels now again, XP really does rot over time), and with it went the pre-installed Microsoft Office (which I just noticed today). But from time to time I have to write a proper document, nothing fancy, all I usually require is to structure the document with different types of headings, and to insert an image or a table here and there. I'm also often switching between my private notebook which I carry around everywhere and my work desktop, which sometimes involves copying said documents around manually. So in lack of an installed MS Word I gave Google Docs a try, and so far I like it. It even makes a nice blog editor, the builtin Blogger editor messes up source code for instance, but with Google Text everything is ok:<br><br><blockquote>Ptr&lt;MyNS::MyClass&gt; myObj = MyNS::Create();<br>IndexT i;<br>for (i = 0; i &lt; myObj-&gt;NumItems(); i++)<br>{<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">// a comment<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">myObj-&gt;ProcessItem(i);<br></div>}<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div></blockquote>Instead of Tab, one must use the "Indent More" and "Indent Less" functions, otherwise the indents will disappear when exporting to Blogger, but all in all this is a huge step forward from Blogger's builtin editor.<br><br>Let's see if tables work as well:<br><br><div><table id="yu10" bgcolor="#ff6666" border="2" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" height="57" width="317"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">Bla<br></td><td width="50%">Blub<br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffff99"><td width="50%">123<br></td><td width="50%">234<br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br>Nice :)<br>
