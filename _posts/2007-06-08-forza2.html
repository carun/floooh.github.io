Yo gang, check out my pimped out Camaro :o) It's way overpowered and handles  like a container ship, so it's totally useless for racing. But that's what a muscle car is all about, right? Need to improve my paint-job skills though...<br /><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cWdorEDEaNg/RmkUk_NcWQI/AAAAAAAAAAs/cVdzQQCyOno/s1600-h/camaro1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cWdorEDEaNg/RmkUk_NcWQI/AAAAAAAAAAs/cVdzQQCyOno/s400/camaro1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5073609080885238018" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Love the game so far... It's much, much deeper then GT4. Could have more tracks though, and the environment graphics are a bit meh for a 360 title. Oh, and definitely not enough BMW models. I'd like to see the new M3 and the Z4 Coup√© please.
