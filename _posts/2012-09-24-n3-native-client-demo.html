After I got the new experimental "Twiggy" pipeline up and running I decided to give Google Native Client another shot, since Twiggy works much better with the "call-on-main-thread" restriction of NaCl. The NaCl port now only differs by a couple of hundred lines of code from the other platform ports which I'm very happy with.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Here's the link to the demo in the Chrome Web Store. You need a recent version of Chrome (at least v.21). So far I only tested this on my MacBook with an nVidia 9400M GPU under OSX and Windows:</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hjgmfoindkamjgdgjlnjgdfceegejpni">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hjgmfoindkamjgdgjlnjgdfceegejpni</a></div><div><br /></div><div>If it doesn't work for you, please leave feedback in the Chrome Web Store, especially which GPU you're using.</div><div><br /></div><div>Have fun!</div><div><br /></div>
