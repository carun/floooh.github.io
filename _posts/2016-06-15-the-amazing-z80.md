title: The Amazing Zilog Z80
---

In the past few months I've become interested (or rather: obsessed) with 8-bit
home computer emulation and 'computer archaeology', which is just a fancy term
for sifting through early-90's web pages, long abandoned USENET groups and
OCR'ed PDFs of old computer manuals and circuit diagrams.

One result of this obsession is a new emulator for East German 8-bit
computers, running in the browser via emscripten:
[http://floooh.github.io/virtualkc/](http://floooh.github.io/virtualkc/).

Originally I wanted to write a blog post about how fascinating this all is
from a non-technical perspective, the cultural and historical aspects, how 
important it is to preserve the 8-bit heritage, how those early computers
with their detailed hardware- and programming-manuals encouraged kids 
to dive into programming and technology, and how all this was lost
during the dark ages of the mid- to late-90's etc etc etc... but I really
suck at stuff like this, it would be an endless rambling.

So instead I'll try to write a little series of blog posts about the 
technical aspects of vintage computer emulation. There's a lot to learn
for the modern-day programmer from those old home computers, which basically
have been complete game programming frameworks cast into hardware, even if it's
just gawking in awe and wonderment how much was achieved with how little
code in those days.

### Heart and Soul

The heart of each emulator is the CPU. It might not be the most complicated part,
but definitely the most tedious and boring to write, mostly because there's
nothing to see for a long time. An emulated CPU that's just hooked up to some
memory and running small test programs is like a brain in a jar, it may 'live',
but without being connected to the world through hands, eyes, ears and mouth it
doesn't make a human. The same with an emulated CPU. It may work and process
instructions, modifying it's internal state, but without a soul - the system
ROM - and a way to communicate with the outside world it won't be an emulator.

And the CPU emulation needs to be nearly complete to successfully boot a system
ROM, and this development phase costs many uneventful evenings, but that moment
when the emulator first boots up and 'something' happens on the screen, even if
it's just flickering pixel garbage... that moment is unforgettable, and from
then on everything else seems easy, even if the really tricky problems are
still ahead.

### The 8-bit Wars

So, where was I... the **Z80**! Heir to the Intel 8080, archnemesis of the
M6502, firestarter of the first battles in the eternal fanboy war: Z80 vs
6502, Commodore vs Atari, Intel vs Motorola, PC vs Mac, Xbox vs Playstation! 

The Z80 was one of the two 'big' 8-bitters of the late 70's and early 80's, 
with the 6502 being the other. It is interesting that Intel was pretty
much absent from the homecomputer arms race. The world was split into two,
the Z80 with Sinclair, Amstrad and MSX machines on one side, 
and the 6502 with Commodore, Apple and Atari on the other.

The two CPUs had very different design philosophies, everything about the
Z80 was big and brute force, it had a lot of registers, a huge instruction
set and ran at up to 4 MHz. The 6502 on the other side was small, cheap and 
(I have to admit even as a Z80 fanboy) - elegant, with the first glimpses
of RISC visible on the horizon.

Oh, and the Nintendo Game Boy and Sega Master System had a Z80 too, so I think
it's safe to say that the Z80 won the 8-bit wars in the end by sheer number.

To understand the Z80 it makes sense to first look at its illegitimate father, 
the Intel 8080:

### From the i8080 to the Z80

The Intel 8080 was released in 1974, and at first glance it looks like a
Z80 cut in half. In reality the Z80 is of course more like two Intel 8080's 
duck-taped together.

The i8080 already has the paired 8-/16-bit register set that's still vaguely
perceptible in modern x86 CPUs 42 years later, and which should look strangely
familiar to everyone who's dabbled in x86 assembly coding:


```
    A  F    
    B  C  => BC                           
    D  E  => DE                          
    H  L  => HL
                                       
             SP
             PC

    flags (F): SZ-H-P-C
```                     

On the left side are the eight 8-bit registers: A,F,B,C,D,E,H,L. Two of those
are special: A is the accumulator, this is where the result of algorithmic
instructions is stored. F is the flag register, which contains status
bits about the result of previous instructions (for instance if the
result is zero or negative, or a carry-over happened).

The remaining 8-bit registers are grouped into 3 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE,
HL), with HL being specialized as general memory pointer. This leaves the two
special 16-bit registers SP (the stack pointer) and PC (the instruction
pointer).

8080 instructions were encoded in a single byte, with all 256 instruction
slots used. Instructions could be followed by one or two bytes of immediate
operands.

In **1974**, a special-projects engineer escaped Intel's secret underground
facilities and defected to the Soviet Union, where he founded OKB-Zilog to
work on a secret weapons program leading to the development of the first
bipedal tank, a 'metal gear'.

Ok I made that up, the Intel engineer was actually Federico Faggin, who lead
the i4004 design group (the world's first commercially available
microprocessor), and he didn't defect to the Soviet Union of course, but
founded Zilog as an American company.  

The Z80 was released in 1976 and built to be an 8080 killer: fully backward
compatible in order to run the dominating CP/M operating system, but with a
much more powerful instruction set and more registers:

```
    A  F           AF'
    B  C => BC     BC'
    D  E => DE     DE'
    H  L => HL     HL'
                     
    I       IX      
    R       IY     
            SP    
            PC

    flags (F): SZ-H-PNC
```

There's a new "shadow register bank" AF',BC',DE' and HL'. These registers are
not directly accessible, but can be swapped very quickly with their main bank
counterparts, for instance, the EXX instruction swaps BC,DE and HL with BC',DE'
and HL', all at once in just 4 cycles which is way faster then writing or
reading even a single register from memory.

Next there's two new 16-bit 'index registers' IX and IY. These enable a powerful
new 'indirect with offset' addressing mode. The IX or IY register would
serve as base pointer, and an 8-bit offset which is directly encoded in the
instruction is added to yield the final 16-bit address.

The remaining register bank enhancements are fairly obscure: the I register
is the 'interrupt vector' to locate the interrupt handler jump table, and the 
'R' register is the 'memory refresh counter', and there's a new flag bit
'N' indicating whether the last instruction was a substraction. All of these
are not very interesting at the moment.

The next big change was the enhanced instruction set, and this is where
things get interesting, especially for emulator writers:

Remember that the Intel 8080 had single-byte opcodes, and all 256 possible
instruction codes were used. How would the Z80 go about cramming additional
instruction slots into an already completely filled up bucket? And how would
all those additional instructions be added without increasing the chip's 
transistor count multiple times?

The answer looks easy and straightforward on the surface, but under the
hoods awaits a mind-blowing (at least to me) engineering marvel of how to
make the most out of very limited resources, hidden in the dark and
undocumented corners of the CPU.

### A Hack Within A Hack Within A Hack

The simple and obvious answer how to extend the instruction set is: through
multi-byte instructions. Instead of encoding all instructions into a single
byte, there are now opcodes with 2 or even 3 instruction bytes. These could be
followed by up to 2 immediate-operand bytes, the longest instructions
can be 4 bytes long and take 23 cycles to complete (the fastest 1-byte
instructions take 4 cycles).

But wait, how would such a multi-byte instruction work if the Intel 8080 
already had all 256 possible instruction slots filled?

The answer is the first inception level: some of those slots were redundant and
implemented the same instructions. They were 'alternative opcodes that should
not be used'.

The 8080 had a number of those redundant slots: 00 is the offical NOP
instruction (doing nothing), but 08, 10, 18, 20, 28, 30 and 38
were also NOPs. All of these alternative NOPs were filled with new 1-byte
opcodes on the Z80 (mostly relative jumps), more interesting were 4 
alternative opcode bytes in the upper instruction range:

The jump-to-address instruction **JMP nn** is at opcode hex C3 (both on the
i8080 and Z80), but on the i8080, the opcode CB _also_ implements JMP nn. And
the **CALL nn** instruction (which calls into a subroutine) at CD even has 3
alternatives at DD, ED and FD.

On the Z80, those 4 byte values CB, DD, ED and FD are used as
lead bytes for the extended multi-byte instructions (of course if
an Intel 8080 program made use of those alternative opcodes it wouldn't run
on a Z80).

The Zilog designers made good use of the multibyte instructions:

The **CB** prefix added a complete set of bit shift and rotate instructions 
(today these are common but totally absent in the 8080), and filled the
rest with the BIT, RES and SET instructions which tested, cleared and set
individual bits.

The **DD** and **FD** prefixes added instruction that used the new 
index-register plus offset addressing modes (DD was for the IX register
and FD for the IY register).

Finally, the **ED** multi-byte instruction group added the so called
'block instructions', and a smaller number of left-overs, like 16-bit
addition, subtraction and load/store instructions.

The 'block instructions' were little CISC monsters. Take for instance the
LDIR instruction, which means 'Load, Increment and Repeat':

It takes a source address in HL, a target address in DE, and a 16-bit count in
BC. When executed, LDIR will load a byte from the address pointed to by HL, and
store it at the address pointed to by DE. It will then increment HL and DE,
decrement BC and repeat the whole load/store/increment/decrement dance until
BC is 0. An entire memory block could be copied in a single instruction! 
Copying one byte this way cost 21 cycles though so it wasn't exactly fast, 
for a few dozen kilobytes LDIR would take multiple seconds to complete.

And now the last question of the puzzle: How could the Z80 designers afford
to increase the instruction count several times without creating a monster
chip? According to Wikipedia the 8080 had about 4.5k and the
Z80 had 8.5k transistors, not even twice as many (unrelated side note: 
the 6502 had around 3.5k transistors).

The answer lies in the undocumented instruction set:

### The Dark Side of the Z80

The undocumented parts of the Z80 are huge and manifold. While the 
Intel 8080 had just 11 'undocumented' instructions, the Z80 instead 
introduced **hundreds** of new undocumented instructions along with 
2 undocumented flag bits (at position 3 and 5), which haven't been 
fully understood by emulator writers until well into the 2000s.

The undocumented instructions in the extended FD and DD ranges
are especially interesting, they explain how all those indexed instructions
using the IX and IY registers could be implemented with minimal
additional chip space:

Looking at the _documented_ index instruction it is clear that the
index registers IX and IY are somehow related to the HL register.

For instance the opcodes to load a 16 bit value into HL, IX and
IY look quite similar:

    LD HL,nn        => 21 n n
    LD IX,nn        => DD 21 n n
    LD IY,nn        => FD 21 n n

The opcode byte 21 is the same, the extended versions just have the
prefix byte DD and FD in front.

The same relation exists for instructions that use the new index addressing 
modes, for instance:

    LD (HL),n       => 36 n
    LD (IX+d),n     => DD 36 d n
    LD (IY+d),n     => FD 36 d n

Again, the base opcode 36 is identical, just the prefix byte, and the 
offset 'd' are added.

All basic 1-byte opcodes that somehow use HL have their counterparts where
IX and IY are used instead of HL.

But those DD and FD instruction groups have huge holes in them. Big areas
seem to be simply unused in the official Z80 documentation. What lies beneath
those unused areas? 

The answer is the second inception level: all those 'unused' instruction slots
are redundant alternatives of 'unextended' base instructions! 

For instance the hex opcode C6 is ADD A,n (add an 8-bit immediate value to
the accumulator A):

    ADD A,n     => C6 n

The prefixed opcode DD C6 is undocumented, what does it do? The answer is:
ADD A,n! It is absolutely identical to the 1-byte instruction which adds
an 8-bit immediate value to A, the same is true for FD C6:

    DD C6 n     => ADD A,n
    FD C6 n     => ADD A,n

Those instructions burn more cycles than their official 1-byte counterpart, so
why do they even exist, why did the engineers 'put them there'?  Why waste
transistors for hundreds of completely useless instructions?

The answer can only be that the designers made clever use of existing resources
and those redundant instructions run on exactly the same transistors as the
documented 'main instruction'. It seems that the only purpose of the prefix
instruction is to 're-wire' the normally used HL register to IX or IY, and
whenever HL would be used as memory pointer, fetch and add an additional offset
byte to IX or IY. Apart from that the indexed instructions are completely
identical to their unextended counterparts, they just take longer because
loading the prefix byte and loading and adding the offset needs more cycles.

The whole cleverness of that instruction re-use becomes much clearer when
actually implementing those parts in an emulator, since the prefix byte for
extended instructions becomes quite literally 'prefix code' which in the end
calls into the same code that actually implements the instruction logic as
the unprefixed 'main instruction', but more on that in the next blog post 
which will be about the Z80 emulator itself!

Oh, and there's also the fascinating story of the Z80's mysterious East
German brother, the U880, but this will also have to wait for another
time :)
