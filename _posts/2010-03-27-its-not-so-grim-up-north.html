I spent a wonderful day at the 2010 Grad Show of <a href="http://www.ltu.se/ske">LTU Skellefteå</a> in Northern Sweden last week. That's a branch of the LTU (Luleå University of Technology) where students learn the arts of film-making and game-development. The game guys use the Nebula "spelmotorn" (what a wonderful word for "game engine") for their projects for quite a while now, and invited me to talk about the engine and the challenges of making Drakensang. It was more of a project management talk and very light on the technical side, but since actual programmers were in the minority I think that was a good decision instead of going straight into hardcore tech stuff.<br /><br />I wish I had a little more time to explore the town and its surroundings. Skellefteå (pronounced roughly like Shealleaf-tyo with emphasis on the 2nd syllable as I learned) is a relatively small town about 25 Swedish miles (1 mile is 10 km in Sweden!) south of the Arctic Circle, and as you can guess, it's still deep winter there. I was lucky to catch a nice sunny day, but the temperature was still only around -10 degree Celsius with about 1 meter of snow and a thick ice layer on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Skellefte%C3%A5,+Sweden&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=37.598824,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Skellefte%C3%A5,+V%C3%A4sterbotten,+Sweden&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=64.746985,20.959679&amp;panoid=lE9teVGV0kW_IO5KgY-1gw&amp;cbp=12,277.07,,0,4.9&amp;ll=64.746969,20.961142&amp;spn=0.004486,0.038581&amp;z=15">river which flows through the town</a>.<br /><br />The town of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Skelleftea&amp;sll=64.839597,22.598877&amp;sspn=2.52745,9.876709&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Skellefte%C3%A5,+V%C3%A4sterbotten,+Sweden&amp;ll=65.07213,23.818359&amp;spn=10.062953,39.506836&amp;t=h&amp;z=5">Skellefteå</a> is really beautiful, with an orderly rectangular layout (so it's basically impossible to get lost). A surprising number of hotels, stores and restaurants are gathering around the town center, and there are <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Skellefte%C3%A5,+Sweden&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=37.598824,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Skellefte%C3%A5,+V%C3%A4sterbotten,+Sweden&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=64.754805,20.937537&amp;panoid=B7wiraPT7re1Iu2eagLM_g&amp;cbp=12,251.7,,0,-4.01&amp;ll=64.754804,20.937538&amp;spn=0.004484,0.038581&amp;z=15">colorful wood-planked town houses </a>in the surroundings.<br />A small airport about 20 km south of town seems to take the role of the railway station. I was surprised to find myself in a packed-full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737">Boeing 737</a> from Stockholm to Skellefteå (for some reason I was expecting <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Douglas_DC-3,_SE-CFP.jpg">something like this</a> ;), when the flight from Berlin to Copenhagen (and back) was only handled by a mere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRJ900">Canadair CRJ900</a> (which - unfortunately - was packed with overweight German businessmen).<br /><br />There's one thing I really like about Swedish people: they don't seem to like pointless small-talk. My seat neighbors on the plane didn't want to know where I come from and where I go to, what I want there, whether I like cats more then dogs or how the German beer is compared to their local beer. The atmosphere on the plane was quiet and relaxed, and I think I never encountered such a disciplined and friendly unboarding of a full plane as on the arrival at Skellefteå. Yet if you're asking for directions, they're friendly and helpful as if they know you for years.<br /><br />Oh Glorious Sweden :)
