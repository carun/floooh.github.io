<p>Today I'm finally doing the transition to Vista. After my first and failed attempt in <a href="http://flohofwoe.blogspot.com/2007/04/back-to-xp.html">April 2007</a> I've now got a new work desktop with 32-bit Vista installed: a Dell XPS with Core2 Duo, 4 GB RAM, NVIDIA 9800 GT and a 700 GB hard disc. It's huge and f*ck-ugly (a true PC indeed), and it glows blue in the dark. Seriously, who's designing those machines nowadays, and for what target audience?</p>  <p>I'm pretty happy with Vista now. Looks like all the problems from 2 years ago have been fixed, disc and network performance seems good, and everything feels &quot;snappier&quot; then on my previous machine (although, given the better hardware specs, it better should!)</p>
