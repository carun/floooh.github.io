**TL;DR:** investigating and fixing memory management overhead in the Oryol
Metal renderer, **OR**: why you should never blindly trust
automatic memory management solutions

Yesterday evening I revisited the Metal renderer for Oryol. There were some
loose ends that needed fixing about some CPU overhead for
reference-counting of Objective-C objects in draw-call-heavy stress-test scenes
with tens-of-thousands of draw-calls. I got this down from initially 
20% to around 7% last October by requesting a command buffer from Metal
which leaves the reference counts of its objects alone, but 
those remaining 7% remained baffling.

**A bit of background info:** In the default 'noob-mode', Metal takes care that
resources that have been released on the CPU side are not destroyed until the
GPU no longer needs them (just like GL or D3D11). This adds some
significant overhead for reference counting (at least it was significant in the
first OSX beta with Metal support, might have been optimized in the meantime).
In an alternative 'danger mode' the *programmer* needs to care about keeping
objects alive that are still in use by the GPU.  I simply fixed this by
putting all resources that are no longer needed into a 'deferred release
queue', which keeps all 'dead' objects around for 2 more render-frames, and then
destroys them, because at that time the GPU is definitely not using them
anymore.

**Ok, back** to those remaining 7% refcounting overhead I was still seeing,
even in 'danger mode'. This was on my MacBookPro, not iPad, and a stress-test
with tens-of-thousands of draw calls (the native version of this [Oryol DrawCallPerf
sample](http://floooh.github.io/oryol/DrawCallPerf.html)). When I tried the
same on my iPad Mini 4, I got some truly shocking results, somewhere between
20% and 40% CPU time spent in \_objc\_retain and \_objc\_release!

The DrawCallPerf render loop applies all 'static state' required for rendering
once per frame, and then in a tight loop, does one Gfx::ApplyUniformBlock() and
one Gfx::Draw() per particle, and this for an increasing number of 3D particles
until everything blows up. The idea of the demo is to roughly find out how
many 'traditional' draw calls a 3D API can handle until the framerate goes
below 60hz.

The Instruments profiler told me that the problem were _objc_retain and
_objc_release calls inside Gfx::ApplyUniformBlock() and not in Gfx::Draw(). In
the Metal backend, ApplyUniformBlock() essentially does a memcpy() into a
global 'uniform buffer', and then binds the current buffer location either to
a vertex or fragment shader bind slot.

The code looks like this (without some debug-mode sanity-checks):

```objc
id<MTLBuffer> mtlBuffer = this->uniformBuffers[this->curFrameRotateIndex];
uint8* dstPtr = ((uint8*)[mtlBuffer contents]) + this->curUniformBufferOffset;
std::memcpy(dstPtr, ptr, byteSize);

// set constant buffer location for next draw call
if (ShaderStage::VS == bindStage) {
    [this->curCommandEncoder 
        setVertexBuffer:mtlBuffer 
        offset:this->curUniformBufferOffset 
        atIndex:bindSlot];
}
else {
    [this->curCommandEncoder 
        setFragmentBuffer:mtlBuffer 
        offset:this->curUniformBufferOffset 
        atIndex:bindSlot];
}
```

Ok ok, the [mtlBuffer contents] call is redundant since it's returning the same
value every time, but at first glance there doesn't seem to be any
evil code which would cause the reference counting go crazy and I lamented
as much on twitter. 

And then:

![metal-arc-1]({{ site.url }}/images/metal-arc-1.jpg)

Indeed, Oryol uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) when compiled with
the Metal backend, and I didn't pay that much attention to it, since it 'just
worked', confirmed by the Xcode static code analyzer. But looking at the
assembly code for the above function I indeed saw one call each to
\_objc\_retain, \_objc\_retainAutorelease and \_objc\_release, and after some
experimentation the culprit turned out to be the temporary **id\<MTLBuffer\>**
variable, not the call to [mtlBuffer contents] as I expected first.

After moving things around a bit (the uniform buffer actually needs to
be bound only once per render-pass), this is the new version of 
Gfx::ApplyUniformBlock() (again, without the debug-mode sanity checks):

```objc
uint8* dstPtr = this->curUniformBufferPtr + this->curUniformBufferOffset;
std::memcpy(dstPtr, ptr, byteSize);
if (ShaderStage::VS == bindStage) {
    [this->curCommandEncoder 
        setVertexBufferOffset:this->curUniformBufferOffset 
        atIndex:bindSlot];
}
else {
    [this->curCommandEncoder 
        setFragmentBufferOffset:this->curUniformBufferOffset 
        atIndex:bindSlot];
}
this->curUniformBufferOffset = Memory::RoundUp(this->curUniformBufferOffset + byteSize, 256);
```

Looking at the assembly code, there's no single reference-counting call
to be found anymore, the only remaining subroutine calls are _memcpy and 
_objc_msgSend:

```
    push    {r4, r5, r6, r7, lr}
    add r7, sp, #12
    str r8, [sp, #-4]!
    mov r4, r0
    ldr.w   r8, [r7, #16]
    ldr.w   r0, [r4, #232]
    mov r5, r1
    ldr.w   r3, [r4, #236]
    mov r6, r2
    ldr r1, [r7, #12]
    mov r2, r8
    add r0, r3
    blx _memcpy
    ldr.w   r0, [r4, #228]
    cmp r5, #0
    ldr.w   r2, [r4, #236]
    beq LBB20_2
@ BB#1:
    movw    r1, :lower16:(L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_63-(LPC20_1+4))
    movt    r1, :upper16:(L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_63-(LPC20_1+4))
LPC20_1:
    add r1, pc
    b   LBB20_3
LBB20_2:
    movw    r1, :lower16:(L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_61-(LPC20_0+4))
    movt    r1, :upper16:(L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_61-(LPC20_0+4))
LPC20_0:
    add r1, pc
LBB20_3:
    ldr r1, [r1]
    mov r3, r6
    blx _objc_msgSend
    ldr.w   r0, [r4, #236]
    add r0, r8
    adds    r0, #255
    bic r0, r0, #255
    str.w   r0, [r4, #236]
    ldr r8, [sp], #4
    pop {r4, r5, r6, r7, pc}
```

And indeed, with these simple fixes, all the retain/release overhead has
disappeared completely from the profiling session, both on OSX and iOS, yay!
