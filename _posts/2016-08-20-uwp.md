title: Universal Windows Platform
---

**TL;DR**: it's a polished turd.

I spent a weekend and some evenings porting Oryol over to UWP (Universal Windows
Platform) to get an idea what the noise is all about. The port is
mostly working (except I/O). There remain problems in 3rd party
libs I'm depending on in the Oryol Extension Samples which I can't fix
without messing around in those libs' source files.

I'm leaving the UWP port unfinished for now because of a combination of
annoying problems with the UWP APIs, and a lack of motivation to spend my
precious sparetime with a platform that ultimately I don't care for since I
neither own an Xbox One nor a Windows Phone.  May be I'll pick up the pieces
later.

Here's a quick rundown of the UWP-specific things in Oryol, and after
that some general thoughts:

- **buildsystem changes** (very similar to iOS or Android):
    - **cmake** needs to know that it should generate an UWP Visual Studio project with
      CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=10.0
    - instead of linking against the various Win32 system libs, link against
      **WindowsApp.lib**
    - you cannot link against the static MSVC runtime libs, only dynamic linking
      is allowed **(/MD instead of /MT)**
    - the **C++/CX dialect must be enabled** by passing the /ZW compiler option,
      at least for the files that talk to the UWP APIs, I have simply
      enabled this for all source files (C++/CX has extensions that enable it 
      to talk to .NET APIs, it's a bit like the C++/ObjC scenario
      in the Apple world)
    - the **/WINMD** linker flag must be set
    - UWP projects need a **Package.appxmanifest** XML file, similar to
      Info.plist on OSX/iOS or AndroidManifest.xml on Android. I'm generating
      a dummy manifest from within cmake, and copy some required placeholder
      images into the right place (splashscreen, icon etc)
    - UWP apps **must be packaged** into an .appx installer before they can
      be started from the Windows desktop, I don't support this yet
      in the build system, but it can be done manually through
      Visual Studio
    - **UWP apps must be signed**, but it looks like Visual Studio creates
      a dummy self-signing certificate during packaging if none is there 
      (this is also similar to iOS or Android)


- **Windows.h** still exists but only offers a subset of the Win32 API, likewise
  with the CRT. Look out for functions that compile and link, but are just
  empty compatibility stubs (like CoInitializeEx()).  Some 3rd-party libs might
  compile, but still not work because of this (in my case: the XAudio2 backend
  in soloud). This is especially annoying because UWP defines all the usual
  preprocessor defines for identifying Win32, but without offering a real Win32
  environment, this will be terrible to debug in a project with a bigger Win32
  API footprint (Oryol minimizes platform-specific code to an absolute minimum,
  so it isn't too bad)

- Most **platform-agnostic code**, and some Win32-specific code will compile
  without changes, there are a couple of new warnings and errors which I fixed
  in my own code, and supressed in external dependencies. The Win32 parts that
  don't compile must be replaced with UWP specific code, which sometimes is
  straight-forward, but most often has lots of little problems because of UWP's
  mobile roots that don't quite fit into a desktop environment.

- **Win32** areas that don't exist anymore and must be removed or replaced with UWP
  code (at least the parts that I encountered):
    - WinMain
    - low-level stuff like getting a stack backtrace
    - anything dealing with the window system, clipboard, WinProc etc...
    - message polling via PeekMessage/DispatchMessage this is done by
      registering event callbacks written in C++/CX
    - WinHttp
    - D3D11 swap-chains are more restricted than their Win32 counterpart

- **weird stuff**, annoyances and things that are worse than Win32:
    - the **application window already exists** before the main function is called,
      and there are some mindboggling restrictions, for instance it is possible
      to listen for size-changed events, but there doesn't seem to be a way to
      change the size of an existing window programmatically, may be it's
      possible but if so it's damn hard to find
    - **C++/CX has new warnings and errors** which may be a problem with
      3rd-party-code (I don't expect that most open source libs will
      be fixed for UWP anytime soon)
    - the whole **UI runs on a different thread** than UWP's main() function, this
      may be a problem for static initializers; in Oryol I'm delaying all
      initialization until the UI thread is running, the entire Oryol
      application is running on the UWP UI thread
    - there is now an **UWP application object**, similar to iOS or OSX, and the
      user-code runs completely from inside callback functions
    - there are **app-lifecycle-events** that must be handled, like suspend/resume,
      and the application is expected to free up memory if asked to do so 
    - the **end of the main() function is never reached**, instead quitting an
      application by clicking the top-right close button just calls the suspend
      event handler, and then the application just 'disappears' from the
      debugger, I thought at first that must be a bug in my code, but 
      the UWP D3D samples behave the same :/
    - I am not sure yet whether app-lifecycle event handler run on another
      thread than UI event handlers, if that is the case it might complicate
      things further
    - **mouse input is mashed together with touch input**, and the API designers
      didn't seem to have thought of the fact that multiple mouse buttons could
      be pressed at the same time, tracking multiple mouse buttons is really
      awkward and has been hacked into the touch API as an afterthought
    - **D3D11 swapchain buffers** cannot simply have MSAA anti-aliasing enabled
    - **key up/down events** with virtual keycodes exist, but the VK enumeration
      lacks a number of keys which makes it useless (casting the enum
      to an integer works, and then the missing keys are there)
    - **debugging** kinda works (take that, Android NDK!), but sometimes the app
      just disappears during debugging (I also had this in the official
      samples, so I guess it's not my code)

- things that are nice^H^H^H **not completely broken**:
    - the C++/CX dialect is pretty weird, but not as weird as Objective-C
    - .appx package files can be quite small (the Oryol core samples are
      between 100 and 136 kBytes, and this includes the dummy PNG images for
      splash screen and icons), and they are installed and started with 3
      clicks
    - uhm, yeah, not much else I think, but I wanted to say at least _something_
      positive ;)

And here's my general take on UWP (as always all IMHO): 

I think for game development, UWP creates more new problem than it fixes because
it is essentially a WinRT-v2 dragged onto the desktop with an incomplete Win32
compatibility layer thrown in. 

Win32 isn't exactly a good API, but at least it has a very small set of
functions that are relevant for game development (open a window and get
keyboard/mouse input). Writing window system glue code is pretty terrible on
every OS, but UWP sucks more than Win32 in this area because of UWP's mobile 
roots.

The UWP mobile application model is outdated and from a time when mobile
devices had a lot less RAM and were much slower than notebooks or desktop
computers. Microsoft would have been wise to not simply copy the nearly 10
years old iOS or Android application models.

With the whole Microsoft mobile strategy dead in the water, UWP looks like a
relict of the past looking for a new platform. The whole mobile part of
UWP no longer matters, but it's exactly those mobile parts that make UWP such a
mess for game development (iOS or Android are not good operating systems for
games either, but these are too big platforms to ignore).

I spent a lot of time thinking about UWP's place in the world while writing the
code for it, and I have come to the conclusion that it is a pure marketing
fabrication, a vision of a 'grand unified theory' of how we shall use
computers onward, born in the ivory towers of 'old Microsoft'. Why UWP has
survived the Windows8 MetroUI meltdown, I don't know. I think it's just the
momentum of thousands of people slowly kicking a dead horse forward.

I'm happy to accept and support pull for requests for Oryol though, as long
as they don't mess up the existing Win32 code too much ;)
