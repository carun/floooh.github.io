Here are the slides to the presentation I gave at the Quo Vadis developer conference last week in Berlin. It's all in German, but it has some pretty pictures in it ;) Unfortunately the Save-As-PDF feature in Powerpoint doesn't embed the video files (only pictures of them), so I packed everything into a zip archive.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.radonlabs.de/internal/drakensang_nebula_quovadis_2008.zip">Here's the link.</a>
