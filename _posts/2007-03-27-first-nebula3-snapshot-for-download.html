I have put together a current snapshot of Nebula3: <a href="http://www.radonlabs.de/internal/nebula3sdk.zip">nebula3sdk.zip</a> . Keep in mind that this is all work in progress, and that there's not much to play around with yet (basically only the Foundation Layer, no 3d rendering yet, etc...). But at least you should be able to try out the stuff I'm writing about here. After installation, look for a Nebula3 SDK entry in the start menu and start with the Documentation. Software requirements and compilation instructions can be found there.<br /><br />Enjoy!
