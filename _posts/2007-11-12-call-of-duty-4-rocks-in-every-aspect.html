<b>  Call Of Duty 4</b> rocks in every aspect. No point in babbling about it here, you really have to see for yourself. If you only play one FPS this year, make it COD4. If the game would have a R6-Vegas-style cover system, it would reach critical mass and collapse into a singularity of pure gaming perfection, thus destroying earth and human civilization. Maybe that's why they left it out.
