I give up, I seriously can't take the pain any longer. No Halo for me until I can get my hands on the english version. Whoever's responsible for the german audio track in Halo3 either needs to be fired or promoted to a position where he can't do any more harm. Why oh why couldn't they simply keep the original audio track and provide german subtitles?
