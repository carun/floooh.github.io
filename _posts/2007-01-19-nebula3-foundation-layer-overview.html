The Nebula3 Foundation Layer provides common platform abstraction services below rendering and audio. It's the lowest layer  in the Nebula3 layer model and can be used on its own for applications which require an easy to use low level framework but don't need to do 3d rendering.<br /><br />The Foundation Layer is already pretty much finished, with a complete set of test classes and performance benchmark classes.<br /><br />The Foundation Layer consists of the following subsystems:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Core: </span>this implements the basic Nebula3 object model, with support for ref-counting, smart pointers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTTI">RTTI </a>and creating objects by class name or a class <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourcc">FourCC</a> identifier.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory: </span>provides memory management and wrapper functions.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Util:</span> a collection of utility classes, mainly different types of containers, a powerful string class, a guid wrapper class and so on...</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timing: </span>this subsystem offers classes for measuring time and profiling.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">IO:</span> An all-new powerful IO subsystem, inspired by the .NET IO framework. IO-Resources are identified by URIs, stream classes provide generic data channels, and stream readers/writers offer specialized access to streams.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Threading: </span>provides low-level wrapper classes for multithreading</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Messaging:</span> This is an improved version of Mangalore's messaging subsystem. Messages are a standardized way to communicate between objects in the same thread, between threads, or between applications on the same machine or across a network.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Math:</span> A standalone vector math library. The idea here is to make math code look much like HLSL shader code, and provide the highest performance possible across different platforms and compilers.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Net: </span>The low-level networking subsystem. Provides wrapper classes for sockets, IP addresses, a simple generic client/server system, and basic HTTP support (for instance a HTTP stream class, making transparent IO over HTTP possible).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scripting:</span> Nebula3's scripting subsystem is much less obscure then Nebula2's, and easier to extend. The standard scripting language is now LUA (as compared to TCL in Nebula2), reducing the memory footprint drastically. Scripting is now no longer tied into the architecture. It is easy to disable scripting all together and reduce the memory footprint even more. It's still possible to add support for other scripting languages in Nebula3.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attr:</span> Implements the concept of dynamic attributes from Mangalore. Attributes are compile-safe key/value pairs, thus offering compile-time validation of attribute names and data types. Attributes are the foundation for the database subsystem.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Db:</span> The database subsystem is an improved version of Mangalore's database subsystem, offering an abstract, performance-optimized interface to a SQL database for storing all types of application data. The standard implementation uses <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> as its database backend, the wrapper code has been carefully tuned for best database performance.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Naming: </span>Implements a hierarchical naming service for Nebula3 objects. Naming is no longer hard-coded into the base class, instead objects can be registered with the naming service at runtime, adding the additional overhead only when needed.</li></ul>
