Just replaced the code which displays my gamer card on the left with something from <a href="http://www.mygamercard.net/">mygamercard.net</a>. The previous one was a simple image, and it seemed to be broken since the recent Xbox Live maintenance (probably because of <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/03/30/hey-where-is-the-gamer-picture-from-the-mozilla-edition.aspx">this</a>). The new one has more functionality but requires JavaScript and Flash. Not sure yet if I like it though. I run Firefox with the NoScript-Addon, and I absolutely despise Flash (at least if an entire web site is implemented in it).
