<p>Dammit, what’s that EA-login bullshit in Burnout Paradise? Didn’t they get the memo from Konami? Turns out my usual email address for shit like this at <a href="mailto:fuck@you.com">fuck@you.com</a> was already taken by somebody else, oh well… Crap like this should be prohibited by Microsoft’s certification process, it’s completely working against the whole idea of Xbox Live.</p>
