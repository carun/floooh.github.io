title: WebAssembly Experiments

**NOTE** to future visitors: the steps described here to get WebAssembly
working will very likely be outdated soon, check the emscripten
documentation how it works in your time period (hopefully it will be
much simpler by then)


Two days ago, the Mozilla, Google and Microsoft browser teams dropped the
bomb by not only announcing experimental WebAssembly support in their browsers,
but (at least in Firefox and Chrome), making it also available to the
'general public' in the bleeding-edge browser builds for testing.

I've added experimental support for WebAssembly code generation to 
[Oryol](https://github.com/floooh/oryol) and [fips](https://github.com/floooh/fips),
and the [Oryol Sample Page](http://floooh.github.io/oryol/) now has WebAssembly
versions of the samples next to the asm.js and PNaCl versions.

To test these you need to get the latest [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/)
and/or latest [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html),
and you need to manually enable WebAssembly support.

- in *Firefox Nightly*: go to **about:config** and set the
  **javascript.options.wasm** option to 'true'
- in *Chrome Canary*: go to **chrome://flags#enable-webassembly** and enable
  the feature there

Then test if it works on the [Sample Page](http://floooh.github.io/oryol/)
by clicking on the **wasm** labels.

But this post is about **building** WebAssembly code, not just looking at it :)

### Getting Started

Currently, building code for WebAssembly requires a number of manual 
steps and a lot of patience for the first setup (depending on internet and 
computer speed: up to a couple of hours). 

Once the WebAssembly binary format has settled down emscripten will get 
proper support to build wasm out of the box, until then this guide (or rather 
'recipe') hopefully helps to ease the path.

I'll describe how to build with emscripten+binaryen as opposed to the official
LLVM wasm backend (which AFAIK is not ready yet). Emscripten first compiles
C/C++ to asm.js, and then in a post-link-step, converts this asm.js code
to binary WebAssembly.

Also, I'll use **Oryol** as code base, since this is already running on 
asm.js, and **fips** as build system (fips is just a bunch of python scripts
around cmake), so I'll skip a lot of details concerning basic 
emscripten compilation, but I'll try to explain all the specific details that
differ between asm.js and WebAssembly build targets.

And finally, I'll start from scratch with an empty directory and everything
will happen inside this directory, at the end you can simply delete this
directory and your machine will (nearly) be in the same state it was before,
with the exception of a few tools installed through standard package managers.

Oh, and I will do everything on **OSX**, with **brew** as package manager. All
steps should translate easily to Linux, but on Windows you're on your own,
sorry (it *should* work on Windows, but very likely involves much more
head-scratching and cursing).

Here's a list of the required steps:

1. get Oryol and setup the emscripten SDK
2. test asm.js compilation
3. get and build binaryen
4. get and build the SpiderMonkey Javascript engine
5. do some minor modifications to the .emscripten config file
6. test WebAssembly compilation

First check whether a few basic tools are in the path:

```
> brew --version
Homebrew 0.9.5 (git revision 4251e; last commit 2016-03-15)
> python --version
Python 2.7.11
> cmake --version
cmake version 3.5.0
> make
make: *** No targets...
```

The latest python 2.x and cmake versions can be installed via brew, make
comes with the Xcode command line tools.

Alright, let's go:

## 1. Get Oryol and setup the emscripten SDK

As promised, everything happens in a separate directory. I'm cloning Oryol with 
a limited history depth to save some time. The emscripten SDK setup
is automated through fips:

```
> mkdir ~/scratch
> cd ~/scratch
> git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/floooh/oryol
> cd oryol
> ./fips setup emscripten
...
```

That little innocent-looking './fips setup emscripten' at the end will take
a little while since it pulls down and compiles an entire LLVM toolchain.

## 2. Test asm.js compilation

Finished? Alright, let's try compile and running one of the samples for asm.js:

```
> cd ~/scratch/oryol
> ./fips set config emsc-make-release
> ./fips make Shapes
> ./fips run Shapes
```

The last command starts a local web server and the default web browser and you 
should see something like this (you may need to refresh if the browser starts
too fast or the web server too slow):

![shapes_asmjs]({{ site.url }}/images/shapes_asmjs.jpg)

Hit Ctrl-C to in the terminal to leave the web server.


## 3. Get and build binaryen

Binaryen is a small plumbing toolkit which (among other things) can convert
asm.js to WebAssembly.

```
> cd ~/scratch
> git clone https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen.git
> cd binaryen
> cmake .
> make
```
We'll just leave that here for a little while and compile Spidermonkey next:


## 4. Get and build Spidermonkey

Ok, this will take a looong time, first we need to get the entire bleeding-edge
Firefox source, and then build the contained Javascript engine
(called Spidermonkey).

This requires mercurial (hg), so install that first, then clone 
the source repo:

```
> brew install mercurial
> cd ~/scratch
> hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/ inbound
```

Next a 'bootstrap' python script is downloaded which installs any further
required tools via brew:

```
> cd ~/scratch/inbound
> curl https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py > bootstrap.py
> python bootstrap.py
```

That bootstrap.py script will ask what version of Firefox you want to build,
select *1. Firefox for Desktop*.

Now, instead of building the entire Firefox, we just build the JS engine:

```
> cd ~/scratch/inbound/js/src
> autoconf213
> mkdir _build
> cd _build
> ../configure
> make
...
```

Compiling will also take a little while...

When it's over there will be a 'js' executable in the dist/bin/ subdirectory.
But we'll leave that also there for later...

## 5. Modify .emscripten config file

Ok the long and tedious part is done, the only thing that's left now
is to tell emscripten where it can find the binaryen tools and the
Spidermonkey JS engine.

The emscripten config file used by fips is located here:

```
~/scratch/fips-sdks/osx/emsdk_portable/.emscripten
```

On Linux, replace the 'osx' with 'linux'. Load the file into a text editor, 
find the SPIDERMONKEY\_ENGINE entry, and change that to the 
path where the previously compiled Spidermonkey 'js' executable is located.

Note that this must be an **absolute** path, for instance on my machine
it looks like this:

```
SPIDERMONKEY_ENGINE = '/Users/floh/scratch/inbound/js/src/_build/dist/bin/js'
```

Next, add a new entry to the end named BINARYEN\_ROOT with the path
to the binaryen directory, on my machine this is:

```
BINARYEN_ROOT = '/Users/floh/scratch/binaryen'
```

Don't forget to replace the 'floh' in both places with your own username :)


## 6. Test WebAssembly Compilation

Ready for testing! Oryol has a new fips build config called 'wasm-make-release'
(under ~/scratch/oryol/fips-configs). This build config switches a cmake option 
on which in turn adds a few more flags to the emscripten linker step, namely:

```
-s BINARYEN=1
-s 'BINARYEN_METHOD="native-wasm"'
-s 'BINARYEN_SCRIPTS="spidermonkify.py"'
-s GLOBAL_BASE=1000
-s ALIASING_FUNCTION_POINTERS=0
```

This tells emscripten to run the build result through binaryen, and a 
'plugin-script' called spidermonkify.py (that's where the Spidermonkey 
JS engine comes in), and the BINARYEN\_METHOD="native-wasm" means it
should only create a wasm file that can be loaded directly by browsers,
without any fallback-options if WebAssembly is not supported.

The last 2 options deal with code-generation details which are required
for WebAssembly, more info here: 
[https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen).

Ok, so let's finally try to build some WebAssembly:

```
> cd ~/scratch/oryol
> ./fips set config wasm-make-release
> ./fips make Shapes
```

Now there's one last manual step required to patch up the required HTML
file depending on whether [this bug](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/4170)
has already been fixed:

Open the file 
```
~/scratch/fips-deploy/oryol/wasm-make-release/Shapes.html
```
And search for **Shapes.wasm**. If there's an absolute filesystem path
in front of it, remove the directory part so that the line looks like this:

```
    xhr.open('GET', 'Shapes.wasm', true);
```

Save and test (don't forget to test in Chrome Canary or Firefox Nightly,
'./fips run' will run the default browser, which is most likely not
Canary or Nightly):

```
> cd ~/scratch/oryol
> ./fips run Shapes
```

If everything works as intended, the result should look exactly as the
asm.js version. You can check the web server output that WebAssembly files
are loaded, e.g.:

```
> ./fips run Shapes
=== run 'Shapes' (config: wasm-make-release, project: oryol):
serving on http://localhost:8000 (Ctrl-C to quit)
...
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Mar/2016 21:29:12] "GET /Shapes.wasm HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Mar/2016 21:29:12] "GET /Shapes.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Mar/2016 21:29:15] "GET /Shapes.wasm.mappedGlobals HTTP/1.1" 200 -
...
```

Don't be confused about that one Javascript file, this contains manually written
glue code (not asm.js) to talk to HTML5 APIs. All the former asm.js code
has been translated into the .wasm file.

And that's it :) Hopefully it won't be too long until WebAssembly support is
properly integrated into LLVM and emscripten so that those manual setup
steps will no longer be necessary!
