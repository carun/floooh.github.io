Here's the new <a href="http://www.radonlabs.de/internal/Nebula3SDK_Jul-2007.exe">July 2007 Nebula3 SDK release</a>. I had to do some restructuring in the directory structure because of the Xbox360 specific stuff (which is not contained of course). Compiling is much faster now because  I switched to precompiled headers. Please keep in mind that everything in the Render Layer is still under construction. The next few posts will mainly describe the various Render Layer subsystems.<br /><br />Have fun!<br />-Floh.
