Just saw the NPD hardware numbers for April. Not only did the PS3 fall under 100k in April (which few dared to predict), it went down to 82k! For giggles, that's even less than the Game Boy Advance (84k). On the other hand, the 360 didn't do very well either, 174k is clearly sub-standard. Nintendo rules the world as usual for this generation, selling more Wiis and DS (and GBA's!) then all of the competition combined.
