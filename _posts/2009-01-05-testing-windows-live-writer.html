<p>Looks like I found a new editor for my blog posts: Windows Live Writer. It's part of the messenger download package here: <a title="http://get.live.com/" href="http://get.live.com/">http://get.live.com/</a></p>  <p>Will checkout the email tool on my private notebook soon. Everything seems to work together with Google services. I think Microsoft finally starts to understand how that Internet thing works ;)</p>
