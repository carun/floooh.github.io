A few words about the current state of Nebula2:<br /><ul><li>Nebula2 is now considered stable, that means no big changes will be done to the Nebula2 code base, except for maintenance, optimizations and ports.<br /></li><li>We recently added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACT">XACT </a>support to Nebula2.</li><li>Development focus has shifted to Mangalore, our high-level game framework, and Nebula3, the next big version of the Nebula Device.<br /></li><li>We created a stripped down Nebula2 version at Radon Labs (dubbed Nebula Embedded), and ported it to the Nintendo DS (internally called Nebula DS). There is currently a team at Radon Labs working on a title for the Nintendo DS.</li><li>Nebula3 will have 3-layer architecture, with the core and graphics subsystems rewritten completely, and Mangalore integrated as the high-level application layer.<br /></li><li>More details on Nebula3 soon on this blog...</li></ul>
