title: "VSCode, C/C++ and fips"
---
I had a closer look at the [VSCode C/C++
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
yesterday and started to add VSCode support to
[fips](https://floooh.github.com/fips).

Here's a very short video how it looked like yesterday (this still used
the standalone LLDB VSCode plugin, I have switched now to the debugger
integration from the standard C/C++ plugin):

Right now this is all very work-in-progress and only works on OSX, but I
used this setup all day today at work and it's already pretty nice! Maybe not yet
Visual-Studio-2015-nice, but overall at least as nice as Xcode or QtCreator,
(some would say that's not a big achievement though ;)

Here's how using VSCode with fips works for the user, this selects a VSCode
build config, generates the project files via cmake, and opens VSCode:

```
> ./fips set config osx-vscode-debug
> ./fips gen
> ./fips open
```

 There are a couple of new build configs (e.g. osx-vscode-debug), the build
 config file contains the information that VSCode should be used as
 'build-tool', for instance the above config looks like this:

```yaml
---
platform: osx
generator: Ninja 
build_tool: vscode_cmake
build_type: Debug
```

The command **./fips gen** does the heavy work, it first generates
the usual cmake project files, queries information about
the project (build targets and header search paths) through
the new cmake-server mode, and finally writes the three VSCode
config files **tasks.json**, **launch.json** and **c\_cpp\_properties.json**
into the local .vscode directory.

Finally **./fips open** starts VSCode (you could just as well run the
usual **code .**, but **./fips open** is the same way Visual Studio or
Xcode would be launched inside a fips project).

In VSCode, one can immediately hit Ctrl-Shift-B (or rather Cmd-Shift-B on OSX) 
to build the whole project, or press Cmd-P and start typing 'task ' to see the list
of build tasks (**./fips gen** wrote one build tasks per cmake build target):

Start typing more and the list of build targets is reduced:

![vscode-2]({{ site.url }}/images/vscode-2.png)

Hit **Enter** and the build will start, building only that target.

For debugging, fips has created a launch config for each executable target in
the cmake project, the list of debug targets is pretty big in the Oryol project
since it has all those Oryol code samples:

![vscode-3]({{ site.url }}/images/vscode-3.png)

Select the target you want to debug and hit F5, debugging 'just works', provided
the target has already been built (there's also a launch option to build the
target before debugging but I haven't tried that out yet). Debugging feels fast, 
much snappier than in Xcode for instance (even though the debugger engine underneath 
is the same). Setting breakpoints while the program runs is working, as well as
conditional and counter breakpoints, callstacks are there, also for threads, etc...

Errors are parsed from the compiler output (more on that later), however this isn't
perfect yet, they show only up after compilation has finished, and stepping through
them with F8 doesn't work right (it only works within the current source file):

One really interesting feature: **./fips gen** also writes a debug target for the
fips code-generation (which uses python scripts). Selecting the
fips-codegen debug target starts the python debugger (this requires the
Python VSCode plugin), however there's also a slight nitpick: this only
works if a python file is currently loaded into the editor. Not sure whether
this is an intended 'feature', an oversight, or an actual bug. But anyway,
switching between C++ and Python debugging in the same project is really
nice, especially for fips projects that make heavy use of code-generation
via python.

For code editing, fips has written the c\_cpp\_properties.json file with
all the header search paths. The VSCode C/C++ plugin uses the paths to resolve
type and symbol information for code completion, Cmd-Click on a name to 
jump to the definition, and so on. Unfortunately proper Intellisense doesn't
work yet though.

And the last nice VSCode featue is the built-in terminal. For fips projects this
is interesting because fips is mainly a command line tool to switch between cmake
build configs (for cross-compiling), and invoke custom 'fips verbs', e.g. for
build automation.

For instance a simple **./fips set config emsc-vscode-release** switches the
current build config to emscripten, hit Cmd-Shift-B and VSCode will build the
emscripten targets instead of native OSX code (debugging emscripten targets doesn't
work though, but who knows, with WebAssembly on the horizon, and VSCode's flexible
debugger extension interface...).

Anyway, here's the VSCode terminal, I use the Fish shell on OSX, and VSCode
picks this up, it feels snappy and I haven't encountered any problems so far:

### How it works under the hood

There are just 2 pieces of python glue code, one to start cmake in 
server mode and get a JSON file with the complete dump of cmake's internal 
data tree (called the 'codemodel'), and another part which loads this JSON
file, finds the relevant pieces of information (targets and header search paths)
and writes the VSCode config files.

The whole code is a bit sloppy/hacky at the moment, especially the whole
cmake-server part. First, I don't know why I need to start it with --debug, 
because otherwise I will simply get an EACCES error (also when starting manually 
from the command line), second: cmake-server is normally intended to be used
as a long-running process which IDEs talk to in order to control cmake's 
project build process. I'm not using it this way, instead I'm only starting it
up, send the necessary commands to get the the codemodel info, and dump 
everything that's coming back from the cmake-server (through stdout) into a 
file.

Here's the code for getting the 'codemodel' info out of cmake (as of the 
time this blog post was written):

[cmake.py](https://github.com/floooh/fips/blob/1076cf4ffe1d66f83d85b22f82586d2e6ca8fc19/mod/tools/cmake.py#L106)

And here's the code which parses the cmake-server output-file, and writes
the various VSCode config files:

[vscode.py](https://github.com/floooh/fips/blob/f7bd4d8e27df357ef4da40e7272c68d6da50aa37/mod/tools/vscode.py#L78)

The code isn't exactly pretty, but whatever ;)

Oh, almost forgot one thing: it took me a bit to figure out how VSCode actually
parses compiler warnings and errors so that they can be clicked on. The concept
is called 'problem matcher', each build task needs its own codematcher item, and
it's basically a regular expression to extract the relevant info pieces from
the compiler error messages. The VSCode docs conveniently have an example
for gcc/clang error messages. A problem matcher looks like this:

[problem_matcher](https://github.com/floooh/fips/blob/f7bd4d8e27df357ef4da40e7272c68d6da50aa37/mod/tools/vscode.py#L64)

And that's it! I think I'll tinker around a bit with VSCode support in the next few
days and also make it work on Linux and Windows. 

With the speed how VSCode is currently evolving I can totally see it as my
main IDE on all platforms in the very near future, the most critical feature
(the debugger) is already working quite well (and that means a lot on OSX
and Linux!), and VSCode made me even switch away from vim for emscripten 
development (except for quickly firing up an editor in a text terminal, 
vim is still much faster for that).

Until next time!
