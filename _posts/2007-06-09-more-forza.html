Holy sh*t. I just discovered that one can download the car setup and the entire replay session of the top 100 players of each career race... No longer guessing how exactly the world's #1 player managed to finish the same race 2 minutes faster, you can watch every single second of it, complete with telemetry information. Awesome. I'm also proud to report that I just finished the Suzuka Circuit at the "Kumho Tire 250HP International" event at position 260 out of roughly 81.000 players who raced there so far. Not too shabby eh? :)
