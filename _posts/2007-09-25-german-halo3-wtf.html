Nooooooooo........                 ...... oooooooh!!!<br /><br />I can't believe this shit! No English audio track in Halo3? It would be ok if the German voice track wouldn't be such a terrible piece of shit. Seriously who did they hire to do the voice overs? Interns? Halo fanboys? It is very easy to get very good voice actors in Germany for a reasonable price. People who actually dub movies as their profession, not some backyard junkies who apparently did the Halo3 voice overs. What an epic fuckup. The voice acting in Halo3 would be just barely ok for a porn movie, not Microsoft's flagship game on the 360.<br /><br />This is going to be hard...
