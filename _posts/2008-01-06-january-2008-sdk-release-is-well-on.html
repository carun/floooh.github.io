The January 2008 SDK release is well on track. I think we'll have to settle for a bimonthly release cycle in the future. While the main chunk of work has gone into the Wii-port (which isn't part of the public SDK release of course) there are still two nice new features for the Win32 version:<br /><br /><ul><li>our modular character system (direct port from Nebula2), so the next testgame.exe application will have proper characters instead of a placeholder geometry<br /></li><li><a title="PSSM" href="http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Efzhang/pssm_vrcia" id="bq87">PSSM</a> shadow support for global light sources</li></ul><br />I feel that PSSM (Parallel-Split-Shadow-Maps) combined with VSM (Variance Shadow Mapping) currently gives the best bang-for-the-buck in terms of quality vs. performance.
