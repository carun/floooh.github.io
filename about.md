This is the blog and personal web page of **Andre Weissflog**.

I work at Bigpoint in Berlin, mostly on the engine
technology behind [Drakensang Online](http://www.drakensang.com/).

Over the years I have helped build and ship a bit over 30 
[game projects](http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,117426/)
at Radon Labs and Terratools.

In my precious spare time I'm mostly doing multi-platform open-source stuff
involving C/C++, Python, emscripten, PNaCl, OpenGL, D3D, 
Metal, and hopefully soon some Rust and Vulkan stuff.

My most interesting github projects are:

* [**Oryol**](http://floooh.github.io/oryol/): experimental, small '3D engine'
* [**fips**](http://floooh.github.io/fips/): a high-level build system wrapper
* [**YAKC**](http://floooh.github.io/virtualkc/): yet another KC85 emulator
